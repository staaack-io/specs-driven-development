# $epic-plan

**Phase:** 3a — Epic planning
**Owning agent:** `.codex/agents/spring-architect.toml`
**Skills used:** `epic-slicing-planning`, `spring-boot-4-conventions`, `openapi-contract-first`, `adr-authoring`, `performance-optimization`

## Purpose
Create high-level Epic planning artifacts before detailed slice-level tasks.

## Inputs
- `<feature-id>`.

## Reads
- `.specs/<feature-id>/01-spec.md`
- `.specs/<feature-id>/02-spec-review.md` (verdict must be `PASS`)
- `.specs/_stack.json`
- `.codex/templates/epic-design.template.md`
- `.codex/templates/epic-roadmap.template.md`

## Writes
- `.specs/<feature-id>/03-epic-design.md`
- `.specs/<feature-id>/03a-epic-roadmap.md`
- `.specs/<feature-id>/adr/NNN-*.md` (if needed)

## Process
1. Refuse if spec review is not `PASS`.
2. Refuse if `01-spec.md` has unresolved `Q-NNN`.
3. Produce `03-epic-design.md`: boundaries, shared architecture decisions, integration points, risks, and ADR links.
4. Produce `03a-epic-roadmap.md`: vertical slices, dependency order, milestone intent, and rollout strategy.
5. Raise `Q-NNN` for any unresolved Epic-level decision and halt before detailed task decomposition.

## Refuse if
- `02-spec-review.md` verdict is not `PASS`.
- Any AC in `01-spec.md` is unaccounted for in Epic design/roadmap.
- Epic-level `Q-NNN` remains unresolved at handoff.

## Done when
`03-epic-design.md` and `03a-epic-roadmap.md` exist, are internally consistent, and the next recommended command is `$plan`.

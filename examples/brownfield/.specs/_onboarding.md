> Coverage was measured ad-hoc by running JaCoCo CLI against the test JARs:

## Findings

1. **Migration tool absent in a Postgres-backed service.** Schema drift is a
   live risk. *Action:* introduce Flyway (`flyway-core` + `db/migration/`),
   baseline `V1__baseline.sql` from `pg_dump --schema-only` of production.
2. **H2 in-memory used for integration tests against a Postgres app.** Tests
   cannot exercise Postgres-specific behavior (jsonb, partial indexes, ON
   CONFLICT). *Action:* swap to Testcontainers Postgres image matching prod
   minor version. Convert the 12 IT tests in one PR.
3. **No format/lint/static-analysis layers.** *Action:* copy
   `shared/maven/parent-pom-fragment.xml` and adopt Spotless + Checkstyle
   immediately (low risk); add SpotBugs after the first format-only PR
   merges to keep diff size manageable.
4. **No coverage enforcement.** *Action:* wire JaCoCo at the **measured
   baseline** (line 71%, branch 58%), then raise the floor by 2pp each
   sprint until it hits the methodology's 90%/90%.
5. **No mutation testing.** *Action:* defer until coverage is at 80%/75%; PIT
   on a low-coverage codebase is noise.
6. **No module boundaries.** *Action:* introduce
   ArchUnit with a single "no cycles" rule first to catch regression while
   the team carves out bounded contexts.
7. **Spring Boot 3.2 vs the methodology's target Spring Boot 4 / Framework 7.**
   *Action:* track as a separate roadmap item; not blocking for `$spec`.
   The harness fragment supports both.

## Recommended next commands (in order)

1. Land the harness POM fragment (PR 1: Spotless + Checkstyle only).
2. Adopt Flyway and baseline against prod (PR 2).
3. Replace H2 IT with Testcontainers (PR 3).
4. Add JaCoCo at baseline floor (PR 4).
5. Add SpotBugs + Error Prone (PR 5).
6. Add OWASP Dependency Check (PR 6).
7. Add ArchUnit "no cycles" rule (PR 7).
8. **Only then** run `$spec` for the first new feature using this toolkit.

The agent will not run `$spec` until at least PR 1–4 are green; otherwise
`$validate` would always fail and the methodology becomes ceremony.

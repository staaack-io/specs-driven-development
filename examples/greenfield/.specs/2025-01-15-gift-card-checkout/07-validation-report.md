## Surviving mutants (3 justified)

1. `GiftCardCodeHasher.hash()`: removed-conditional mutant on the `if (salt == null)`
   defensive branch that's unreachable because `salt` is `@NotNull`-validated by
   `@ConfigurationProperties`. **Justification accepted** — defensive null check.
2. `GiftCardEntity.amountToDebit()`: incremented constant in `Math.min` arg. The
   mutant was equivalent — both sides yielded the same `Money` because the
   coverage test uses balance == subtotal. Added a follow-up test that uses
   distinct values; mutant now killed.
3. `IdempotencyStore.save()`: removed-conditional on the duplicate-key catch.
   The catch is exercised by `IdempotentRedeemIT`; the surviving mutant flips
   to ignoring all `DataIntegrityViolationException`s, which our test
   doesn't distinguish from success because both paths return the same
   `Applied` payload. **Justification accepted** — the contract is "same payload
   returned"; the mutant preserves it. Tracked under `08-code-review.md` as a nit.
